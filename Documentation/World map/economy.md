# Start
Player starts a game with a handful of resources and a single starting city.
To progress he needs to buy one of the 3 available heroes, each with different power and cost.



1 (Cheap) - almost free
	average early game
	fastest mid game -> strongest
	fastest late game -> but weakest

	Aggresive option, has to always play the game fast

2 (Average) - Decent cost
	low early game resources -> weak early game
	decent scaling -> average mid game
	average late game

	Safest option, needs to play defensive mid game against 1(cheap) and has to force timing attack against 3(expensive)

3 (Expensive) - Costs all starting ruby
	Strong hero -> provides easier early game
	Caps early city progression  -> forcing hard mid game
	Slowest late game  -> high level on best hero

	Cheese, can rush opponents resource outposts but has to camp during mid game hoping to survive to late game
